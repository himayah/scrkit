// anything else is currently drawn on top of it. Pure pixel math, no
// Windows dependency, so (like the rest of src/core/) it's unit-testable on

// individual window/icon positions via EnumWindows and the desktop's icon
// ListView, and capturing each individually via PrintWindow), which did not
// hold up in practice on a real machine.
